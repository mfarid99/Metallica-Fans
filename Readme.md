This project uses Mongo/Express/React to creat an APP where Metallica fans can upload their best live show photos and comment on their experiences attending a Metallica concert. The user can add his/her name, date & location of the concert, upload a photo and comment on the concert itself. When they are done, the data will display on the main page. The user can also edit the information or delete it all together. When the app is opened, a new user is prompted to sign up and after signing up, user is prompted to log in to gain full access of the app. 

This is a full stack application that uses Node.js, Mongoose, Express/React. It adheres to MVC file structure including Models, Views and Controllers. 

It uses 1 model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD. 

The app is deployed via Heroku.
